       <h1>THE ORIGIN BEHIND CORDOVA'S NAME AND ITS BARANGAYS</h1><br>
       <img src="Img/museum.jpg" alt="" class="cordova">
       <p>
"Cordova is not the original name of the territory it presently represents, nor even the Spanish name "Cordoba". Its territory comprises the original barrios ("balangays" in Cebuano) of Gabi, Day-as, and Pilipul (actually Pilipog)-all of which are located in the southern tip of Mactan Island. The three Balangays became known as the town of Cordoba on May 22, 1863. Governor -General Rafael de Echague y Birmingham decreed it. The townspeople wanted to adopt one of the names of the three balangays as the town's name. "Gabi" and Pilipog are names of a root crop and coconut variety, respectively. Their choice was Day-as, which means "to venture or dare". However, Governor General Echague chose the name "Cordoba which means stark nakedness" and "bare". Echague, a Spaniard, certainly derived the name from Cordoba, Espana.</p>

Except for Ibabao (created in 1913), Catarman (established on May 3, 1922) Buagsong and Bangbang (in the 1930's), the rest of the barangays of Cordova were created after the war: Cogon, Dapitan, San Miguel, Alegria, and Gilutongan. When still part of Pilipog, Cogon was fully covered with grass locally known as cogon, hence its name.</p>
